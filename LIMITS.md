Limit your upload to 100 batches/sec and 1000 events/sec. You can batch events into an upload but we recommend not sending more than 10 events per batch. Thus, we expect at most 100 batches to be sent per second, and so the 1000 events/sec limit still applies as we do not recommend sending more than 10 events per batch. Note: This applies to customers on our Starter Plan only.
